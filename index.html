                    <h5>The budgie, one of the smallest of the parrot species, occupies a big spot in the hearts of bird
                        lovers
                        all over the world. They are the birds you are most likely to see in pet stores making them the
                        most
                        commonly kept parrot in captivity.

                        They are colorful, friendly and quiet enough to make great apartment birds. Their cages do not
                        take up the
                        entire living room or empty out the savings account. For many people, a budgie was their first
                        bird, and
                        perhaps the one responsible for their life-long love affair with all parrot species.

                        Budgies have gained much notoriety for their accomplishments. The 1995 Guinness Book Of World
                        Records
                        documents Puck, a tiny blue budgie, with the largest parrot vocabulary on record with 1,728
                        words and
                        phrases spoken. It is a title most parrot aficionados would have assumed belonged to the African
                        grey.</h5>

                    <h5 class="mt-3 justify">Budgies need to be trained because they are very adept fliers. While they
                        aren’t
                        capable of landing a bite that will send you to the hospital for stitches, nor are they loud
                        enough to
                        damage your hearing (although for what they lack in volume they can more than make up for in
                        persistence),
                        your bird does have one huge advantage over you: it can fly!

                        They have the speed and maneuverability that is to be expected for a bird of their size, and
                        they are
                        natural masters at evading human hands. Even with the best of intentions, our huge hands “snatch
                        up” little
                        birds to take them out of the cage against their will or to put them back in before they are
                        ready to go.

                        So what do you suppose happens when you have a budgie with advanced flight skills that is afraid
                        your hands?
                        If you guessed that you would spend the next three hours trying to corner and capture your bird
                        to get it
                        back in the cage, you are correct.

                        This misadventure will give your tiny bird even more reason to fear your big hands!</h5>
